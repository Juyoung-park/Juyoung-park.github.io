Hello! I've finally created my personal blog.

## Starting the Blog

Although I work as a software engineer, I didn't have a personal tech blog. 
Now I'm running a blog built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Future Plans

I plan to share the following content on this blog:

- **Technology Learning Journey**: Experiences while learning new technologies
- **Development Tips and Know-how**: Useful development tips from practical work
- **Project Reviews**: Retrospectives and lessons learned from completed projects
- **Thoughts as a Developer**: Development culture, career, and developer concerns

## Conclusion

I look forward to consistently maintaining this blog and growing together with the developer community. 
I appreciate your interest and feedback! 🚀
