Create Repository   Create a repository in the format username.github.io on GitHub.   2. Apply Jekyll Theme   I used the Minimal Mistakes theme:   remote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\"   3. Basic Configuration   Set site information in the _config.yml file:   title: \"Juyoung Park\" description: \"Juyoung Park's personal tech blog.\" url: \"https://juyoung-park.github.io\"   Writing Blog Posts   Post Structure   --- layout: post title: \"Post Title\" date: 2024-06-05 10:00:00 -0400 author: Juyoung Park categories: [category] tags: [tag1, tag2] ---  Post content...
