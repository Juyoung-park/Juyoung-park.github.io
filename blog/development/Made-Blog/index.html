<p>Hello! Iâ€™ve finally created my personal blog.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-blog">Starting the Blog</h2>

<p>Although I work as a software engineer, I didnâ€™t have a personal tech blog. 
Now Iâ€™m running a blog built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>

<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>

<p>I plan to share the following content on this blog:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Technology Learning Journey</strong>: Experiences while learning new technologies</li>
  <li><strong>Development Tips and Know-how</strong>: Useful development tips from practical work</li>
  <li><strong>Project Reviews</strong>: Retrospectives and lessons learned from completed projects</li>
  <li><strong>Thoughts as a Developer</strong>: Development culture, career, and developer concerns</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I look forward to consistently maintaining this blog and growing together with the developer community. 
I appreciate your interest and feedback! ðŸš€</p>
